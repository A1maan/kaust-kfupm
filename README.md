# KAUST Academy – Introduction to AI (2026 Cohort)
A lightweight microsite for the KAUST Academy AI program (only Stage-2 currently) at KFUPM. It hosts daily decks, labs, quizzes, and extra practice inside `dayX/` folders with shared assets in `/assets`.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a browser or run a static server (`npx serve .`).
2. Navigate via the top menu to reach each day’s materials and the centralized quiz runner (`quiz.html`).

## Structure
- `day1/… day5/`, `extra/` – individual pages plus quizzes or special content per day.
- `assets/` – shared CSS, JS, and vendor libraries.
- `Exercises/`, `Labs/`, `Slides/` – raw notebooks and PDFs referenced on the site.
